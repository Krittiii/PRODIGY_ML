Task 3: Implementation of a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. 

Image classification plays a pivotal role in organizing and indexing the insane amount of images that exist on the internet so that they can be easily used by individuals and organizations alike.

Expanding on my previous endeavors, this project delves into the captivating realm of computer vision, employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the renowned Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset.

Why is this project captivating?

• Image classification is a cornerstone of computer vision, with broad-ranging applications.
• This project lays the groundwork for practical applications such as:
- Pet identification in photos or videos.
- Automated image tagging for efficient content organization.
- Animal shelter management through image-based classification.
Here's an overview of what the code accomplishes:
• Loading and preprocessing of cat and dog image data to ensure optimal model performance.

• Feature extraction from the images, potentially utilizing techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

• Training an SVM classifier based on the extracted features and corresponding image labels.

• Evaluation of the model's efficacy in classifying unseen images.

Beyond the Basics:
-While SVM is effective, deep learning models often outperform traditional methods in image classification tasks. Techniques like transfer learning can be advantageous, particularly when training data is limited.
